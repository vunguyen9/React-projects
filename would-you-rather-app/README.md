# WOULD YOU RATHER APP

## Project:

Leverage the strengths of Redux to build a "Would You Rather" application where users are given questions and must choose one of them. We can create our own sets of questions, choose between them, and keep track of question popularity.

## How to install and launch the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Runs this to install all the project dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser


For reference, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
